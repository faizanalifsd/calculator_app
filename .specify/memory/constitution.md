# Calculator Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modularity
**Description:** Components should be self-contained and independently testable.
**Rationale:** Promotes reusability and maintainability.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Description:** Write tests before writing production code to ensure functionality and guide design.
**Rationale:** Improves code quality, reduces bugs, and clarifies requirements.

### III. Clear Interfaces
**Description:** Define explicit and well-documented interfaces for all modules and components.
**Rationale:** Facilitates integration and reduces coupling.

### IV. Code Readability
**Description:** Write clean, concise, and understandable code with consistent formatting and meaningful names.
**Rationale:** Enhances maintainability and collaboration.

### V. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
**Description:** Automate build, test, and deployment processes to ensure rapid and reliable delivery.
**Rationale:** Accelerates development cycles and reduces deployment risks.
